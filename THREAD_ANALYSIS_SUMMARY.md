# DJI PSDK THREAD ANALYSIS SUMMARY
# ================================

echo "=== DJI PSDK Thread Issue Analysis ==="
echo ""
echo "ROOT CAUSE FOUND:"
echo "The C++ sample was unconditionally compiling ALL C module samples,"
echo "including widget and data transmission modules, regardless of"
echo "configuration flags in dji_sdk_config.h"
echo ""
echo "ISSUE DETAILS:"
echo "1. CMakeLists.txt had: ../../../../sample_c/module_sample/*.c"
echo "2. This included widget/*.c and data_transmission/*.c always"
echo "3. application.cpp included widget/test_widget.h unconditionally"
echo "4. These modules created user_widg and user_tran threads"
echo ""
echo "FIXES APPLIED:"
echo "1. ✅ Modified CMakeLists.txt to exclude widget and data_transmission"
echo "2. ✅ Removed widget/data_transmission includes from application.cpp"
echo "3. ✅ Configuration already set to disable these modules"
echo ""
echo "EXPECTED RESULT AFTER REBUILD:"
echo "These threads should NO LONGER appear:"
echo "❌ user_widg (widget threads)"
echo "❌ user_tran (data transmission threads)"
echo ""
echo "These threads should STILL be present (required for liveview):"
echo "✅ startup_b (bootstrap)"
echo "✅ logger_ta (logging)"
echo "✅ root_task (main SDK)"
echo "✅ linker_ta (internal)"
echo "✅ downloade (downloader)"
echo "✅ bulk_recv (USB receiver)"
echo "✅ liveview_ (LIVEVIEW PROCESSING)"
echo ""
echo "NEXT STEPS:"
echo "1. Transfer updated files to Raspberry Pi"
echo "2. Clean rebuild: rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make"
echo "3. Test liveview: should now work with reduced USB contention"
echo ""
echo "USB BANDWIDTH SHOULD NOW BE OPTIMIZED FOR LIVEVIEW!"
